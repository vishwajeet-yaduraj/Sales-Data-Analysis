## Sales Data Analysis Project
## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of sales data collected over a 12-month period. The goal of the project is to address key business-related questions that can help a company optimize its sales strategies, improve marketing efforts, and enhance overall business performance.

## Business Questions Addressed
1. What was the best month for sales, and how much was earned that month?
Purpose: Understanding seasonal trends and identifying peak sales periods can help businesses optimize inventory, staffing, and marketing efforts.
2. Which city had the highest sales value?
Purpose: Knowing the top-performing locations can assist in targeted marketing campaigns, inventory distribution, and potential expansion decisions.
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customers buying products?
Purpose: Timing is crucial for marketing efforts. This analysis helps determine the optimal times to run ads for maximum impact.
4. What products are most often sold together?
Purpose: Identifying common product combinations can guide bundling strategies, cross-sell opportunities, and personalized marketing offers.
5. What product was sold the most?
Purpose: Understanding the top-selling products helps in managing inventory, identifying customer preferences, and planning promotions.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of sales data from January to December, containing the following columns:

Order ID: Unique identifier for each order
Product: Name of the product sold
Quantity Ordered: Number of units ordered
Price Each: Price per unit of the product
Order Date: Date and time the order was placed
Purchase Address: Address where the order was delivered

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis, the following data cleaning steps were performed:

Null Values: Removed rows containing null values to avoid inaccuracies in analysis.
Data Type Conversion: Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types:
Order Date was converted to datetime.
Quantity Ordered and Price Each were converted to int and float respectively.
Duplicate Removal: Identified and removed duplicate entries where necessary.
Data Consistency: Ensured consistency in product names and addresses.

## Analysis and Visualizations

1. Best Month for Sales
Method: Grouped data by month and calculated the total revenue for each month.
Result: Identified the month with the highest sales and visualized the monthly revenue trends using a bar chart.
2. City with the Highest Sales
Method: Extracted city information from the Purchase Address column and grouped sales data by city.
Result: Determined the city with the highest total sales and visualized city-wise sales performance.
3. Optimal Advertisement Timing
Method: Analyzed order times to find the hours during which the highest number of purchases were made.
Result: Suggested the best time slots for running advertisements, supported by a line graph of sales by hour.
4. Products Most Often Sold Together
Method: Used combinations and counting techniques to find the most common product pairs in the same order.
Result: Identified frequently sold product combinations, which were then visualized to show popular bundles.
5. Most Sold Product
Method: Summed the quantities of each product sold.
Result: Determined the top-selling product and visualized the sales volume for all products using a bar chart.
